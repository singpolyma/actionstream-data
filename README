This git repository serves as a synchronization point for content made for the Movable Type Action Streams plugin and the DiSo ActionStream Wordpress plugin.

The YAML files describe services and activity streams that may be scraped from them (and how to go about the scraping).

Patches accepted.  Please keep the YAML in alphabetical order.  Please put appropriate microformats on all HTML snippets.  Please keep icons in PNG format.
